Speech Sentiment Analyzer

About the Project:

The project is aimed at building a review assistant bot that can empathize with the customers when they provide feedback. The analyzer is designed to take audio reviews about a restaurant from the customers, analyze the sentiment and provide suitable audio response in order to give individual attention to customers. According to me, this could build a strong customer relationship i.e.; by empathizing with them, post analyzing their reviews. Let's say thanking them for the constructive feedback or by apologizing for any lapse in service or quality. Such an assistant can be leveraged(is probably already being leveraged) not only for enhancing customer relations but also for real-time storage of categorized review sentiment into the database for any further deep dive or analyses.

The text pre-processing was done using my own customized tokenizer. For classification of reviews, I built a Naive Bayes classifier which gave an accuracy of ~78%.
    
This is my attempt at an improvised natural language processing model which facilitates speech inputs/outputs in a world which has lesser and lesser time for providing written feedback/reviews.
